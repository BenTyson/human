## 🚨 **ISSUES & BLOCKERS**

### **Current Issues:**
- None identified yet (project just started)

### **Potential Risks:**
1. **Discrepancies between online calculators** - May need to research which is most authoritative
2. **Access to official calculation specifications** - May need to reverse-engineer from results
3. **Historical timezone data accuracy** - Need reliable DST information for older dates

## 📝 **NOTES & OBSERVATIONS**

### **Key Insights from Previous Attempts:**
1. **Swiss Ephemeris works correctly** - Astronomical calculations were accurate
2. **Gate mapping was the issue** - Wrong gate wheel or coordinate system
3. **88-degree calculation precision** - Binary search method achieved perfect arc
4. **Reference data may vary** - Need to establish single source of truth

### **Lessons Learned:**
- Don't assume methodology - verify everything against working calculators
- Build incrementally with continuous testing
- Document decisions and reasoning clearly
- Maintain detailed progress tracking
