## üîç **VERIFICATION METHODOLOGY**

### **Primary Verification Process:**

1. **Input Standardization**
   - Use identical birth data format across all calculators
   - Ensure consistent timezone handling
   - Verify location coordinates if possible

2. **Core Data Comparison**
   - Personality Sun/Earth gates and lines
   - Design Sun/Earth gates and lines
   - All 13 planetary activations
   - Centers definition (9 centers)
   - Energy Type determination

3. **Advanced Features Comparison**
   - Profile calculation
   - Authority assignment
   - Definition type
   - Incarnation Cross format
   - Strategy and Not-Self themes

4. **Discrepancy Resolution**
   - Document any differences between calculators
   - Investigate methodology differences
   - Establish consensus based on majority agreement
   - Prefer official sources (MyBodyGraph, Jovian Archive) for conflicts

### **Testing Protocol:**

```
For each test subject:
1. Generate chart on MyBodyGraph (primary reference)
2. Generate chart on GeneticMatrix (verification)
3. Generate chart on 2-3 additional calculators
4. Compare all key data points
5. Document consensus results
6. Note any discrepancies for investigation
7. Update test-data.md with verified results
```

## üìñ **HUMAN DESIGN SYSTEM COMPONENTS**

### **Core Calculation Elements:**

1. **64 Gates (I Ching Hexagrams)**
   - Each gate covers 5.625 degrees (360¬∞ √∑ 64)
   - 6 lines per gate (each line ‚âà 0.9375 degrees)
   - Based on tropical zodiac coordinates
   - Reference: Official Jovian Archive gate definitions

2. **9 Centers (Chakra System)**
   - Head, Ajna, Throat, G/Identity, Heart/Ego, Sacral, Spleen, Solar Plexus, Root
   - Defined by specific gate activations
   - Reference: Official center-gate associations

3. **36 Channels**
   - Each channel connects two gates
   - Requires both gates to be activated
   - Reference: Official channel definitions

4. **5 Energy Types**
   - Manifestor, Generator, Manifesting Generator, Projector, Reflector
   - Determined by center definitions
   - Reference: Official type determination rules

### **Calculation Components:**

5. **Personality Calculation**
   - Based on exact birth time and location
   - 11 planetary positions + North/South Nodes
   - Tropical zodiac coordinates
   - Swiss Ephemeris recommended for accuracy

6. **Design Calculation**
   - Approximately 88 degrees of solar arc before birth
   - Same 13 positions as personality
   - Method: Research exact 88¬∞ vs ~88 days

7. **Profile System**
   - Based on Sun gate lines (Personality/Design)
   - 12 possible profiles (1/3, 1/4, 2/4, 2/5, 3/5, 3/6, 4/6, 4/1, 5/1, 5/2, 6/2, 6/3)
   - Reference: Official profile descriptions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **KNOWN ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE**

### **Common Discrepancies Between Calculators:**

1. **Design Calculation Variations**
   - Some use fixed ~88 days
   - Others use exact 88¬∞ solar arc
   - Need to determine which is standard

2. **Timezone Handling**
   - Historical DST variations
   - Location coordinate differences
   - UTC conversion methods

3. **Precision Differences**
   - Rounding in line calculations
   - Swiss Ephemeris vs other astronomical sources
   - Degree precision (seconds vs minutes)

4. **Gate Boundary Edge Cases**
   - Positions exactly on gate boundaries
   - Different rounding approaches
   - Leap year considerations

### **Research Questions:**

- What Swiss Ephemeris settings do official calculators use?
- Are there differences between Human Design "schools" or systems?
- How are leap seconds handled in astronomical calculations?
- What coordinate reference frame is used (J2000, Date, etc.)?
