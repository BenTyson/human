## üîç **VERIFICATION PROCESS**

### **Step 1: Cross-Reference Online Calculators**
Test each subject's birth data with multiple online Human Design calculators:

1. **MyBodyGraph** (https://mybodygraph.com)
2. **GeneticMatrix** (https://geneticmatrix.com)
3. **HumDes** (reference calculator)
4. **64keys.com** Human Design Calculator
5. **JovianArchive.com** (if available)

### **Step 2: Document Consensus Results**
- Record results from each calculator
- Note any discrepancies between calculators
- Establish consensus on "correct" results
- Update expected results based on majority consensus

### **Step 3: Verify Specific Components**
For each subject, verify:
- [ ] **Personality & Design Sun/Earth positions**
- [ ] **All 13 planetary activations** (11 planets + North/South Nodes)
- [ ] **Centers definition** (which of the 9 centers are defined/undefined)
- [ ] **Channels activation** (which of the 36 channels are active)
- [ ] **Energy Type determination** (Generator, MG, Projector, Manifestor, Reflector)
- [ ] **Profile calculation** (derived from Sun/Earth lines)
- [ ] **Authority assignment** (based on defined centers hierarchy)
- [ ] **Definition type** (Single, Split, Triple, Quadruple, No Definition)
- [ ] **Incarnation Cross formatting** (Sun/Earth personality/design gate sequence)

### **Step 4: Document Astronomical Data**
For verification of our astronomical calculations:
- [ ] **Birth time in UTC** for each subject
- [ ] **Julian Day Number** for personality calculation
- [ ] **Julian Day Number** for design calculation (88 degrees before)
- [ ] **Exact planetary longitudes** in tropical zodiac coordinates
- [ ] **Gate and line assignments** for each planetary position

## üìù **RESEARCH NOTES**

### **Methodology Questions to Research:**
1. **Design Calculation**: Is it exactly 88 degrees of solar arc, or approximately 88 days?
2. **Gate Boundaries**: What are the exact tropical degree ranges for each of the 64 gates?
3. **Line Calculation**: How are the 6 lines distributed within each gate's degree range?
4. **Coordinate System**: Confirmed tropical (not sidereal) zodiac coordinates?
5. **Swiss Ephemeris Settings**: What calculation flags and reference frame?

### **Common Discrepancies to Watch For:**
- Minor differences in minutes/seconds due to precision
- Different design calculation methods (fixed days vs exact arc)
- Timezone handling differences (especially historical DST)
- Rounding differences in line calculations

## üîç **CROSS-REFERENCE ANALYSIS**

### **Calculator Consensus Results:**

#### **Perfect Agreement:**
- **Ben**: All foundational properties match between Bodygraph and GeneticMatrix
- **Elodi**: All foundational properties match between Bodygraph and GeneticMatrix

#### **Perfect Agreement - All Subjects:**
- **Dave**: ‚úÖ Generator, 5/1 Profile, Split Definition, Sacral Authority (Both calculators)
- **Ben**: ‚úÖ Manifesting Generator, 1/3 Profile, Single Definition, Sacral Authority
- **Elodi**: ‚úÖ Generator, 4/1 Profile, Split Definition, Sacral Authority

### **Key Observations:**
1. **Design Date Calculation**: Both calculators use approximately 88 days before birth
2. **Gate Degrees**: GeneticMatrix provides precise tropical degrees for all gates
3. **Tropical System**: Both calculators confirmed using tropical zodiac coordinates
4. **UTC Conversion**: Both handle timezone conversion consistently
5. **Birth Year Sensitivity**: One year difference significantly impacts calculations

### **Research Questions from Analysis:**
1. **Design Arc**: Is calculation exactly 88¬∞ or approximately 88 days?
2. **Gate Boundaries**: Need exact tropical degree ranges for all 64 gates
3. **Line Calculation**: How are 6 lines distributed within each gate?
4. **Year Precision**: How sensitive are calculations to exact birth dates?
