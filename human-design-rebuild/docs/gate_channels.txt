## 4. Energy Type Determination Rules

### MANIFESTOR
- Defined Throat Center connected to a motor center (Heart, Solar Plexus, or Root)
- Undefined Sacral Center
- Motor to Throat connection required

### GENERATOR
- Defined Sacral Center
- No motor to Throat connection

### MANIFESTING GENERATOR
- Defined Sacral Center
- Motor to Throat connection (Sacral counts as motor)

### PROJECTOR
- Undefined Sacral Center
- No motor to Throat connection
- At least one defined center

### REFLECTOR
- All 9 centers undefined

## 5. Authority Hierarchy

1. **Emotional Authority**: Defined Solar Plexus
2. **Sacral Authority**: Defined Sacral (no defined Solar Plexus)
3. **Splenic Authority**: Defined Spleen (no Sacral or Solar Plexus)
4. **Ego Authority**: Defined Heart connected to G Center or Throat
5. **Self-Projected Authority**: Defined G Center connected to Throat
6. **Mental Authority**: Defined Ajna and/or Head (Projectors only)
7. **Lunar Authority**: No inner authority (Reflectors only)

## 6. Definition Types

### SINGLE DEFINITION
- All defined centers connected in one continuous circuit

### SPLIT DEFINITION
- Two separate groups of defined centers

### TRIPLE SPLIT DEFINITION
- Three separate groups of defined centers

### QUADRUPLE SPLIT DEFINITION
- Four separate groups of defined centers

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Center Definition Logic
```
A center is defined if:
1. Both gates of at least one channel touching the center are activated
2. The activation can be from conscious (black) or unconscious (red) data
```

### Channel Activation Logic
```
A channel is active if:
1. Both gates forming the channel are activated
2. Gates can be activated by different sources (e.g., one from Sun, one from Moon)
```

### Type Determination Algorithm
```
1. Check if all centers undefined → REFLECTOR
2. Check if Sacral defined:
   - If yes, check motor→throat → MG or GENERATOR
   - If no, check motor→throat → MANIFESTOR or PROJECTOR
```

### Connection Paths for Motor-Throat
- Heart to Throat: 21-45, 26-44
- Solar Plexus to Throat: Direct channels or through other centers
- Root to Throat: Through intermediate centers only
- Sacral to Throat: Through intermediate centers only
