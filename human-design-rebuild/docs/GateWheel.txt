Complete Human Design Gate Wheel
All 64 Gates with Tropical Degree Ranges
Key Information:

Each gate spans exactly 5.625 degrees (360° ÷ 64 gates = 5.625°)
Each line within a gate spans 0.9375 degrees (5.625° ÷ 6 lines = 0.9375°)
The gates follow the tropical zodiac system (seasonal/earth-sun relationship)
Gates are arranged in the order they appear around the Rave Mandala (not numerically 1-64)

Important Notes

Gate Overlap at Sign Boundaries: Several gates span across zodiac sign boundaries (like Gate 3 spanning from late Aries into early Taurus), which is normal in the Human Design system.
Line Calculations: Each line within a gate spans approximately 0.9375 degrees, so lines progress every ~0.94 degrees within each gate.
Tropical vs. Sidereal: This system uses tropical astrology (based on seasonal/earth-sun relationship) rather than sidereal astrology (fixed star positions).
Solar Transit Pattern: The Sun spends approximately 5.5-6 days in each gate, progressing through all 6 lines before moving to the next gate.
Gate Order: The gates don't follow numerical order (1-64) around the wheel but instead follow a specific sequence based on the I-Ching arrangement on the Rave Mandala.

Determining which gate a planet was transiting at specific degrees
Understanding the astrological context of activated gates
Following current transits and their Human Design implications
